# Udacity project - Data Science blog post

## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to Insights and Stack Overflow for curating such data sets and special thank to Stack Overflow community for being helpful and frequently answering many of my technical questions.

## Motivation:
This repository contains my companion notebook to my first data science blog post [here](sss). The objective is to carry on a complete data science process and communicate insights to a broad non-technical audience.

## Main results
In this blog, I tackled current tech trends and next year evolutions. Outside a technical scope, the analysis show that a professional developper work experience is highly impacted by human factors (management support or good work place culture) even more than financial consideration in some cases. I hope these insights help you decide for your next professional move :)
